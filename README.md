A multiplayer game to check on your finger twisting abilities. Get busy bending.
Installation and running- Download the zip file. Unzip it and open the project using Android Studio. Run it on emulator/Android device.

The app is a 2 player game which asks for the names of the players at the beginning. On the next screen, you are required to enter the 
number of blocks you wish to have in your game screen. On the very same screen, you can use menu to view rule and also check 
How many maximum touches does your device support.

I've worked on the Motion events for the game play. Rest all is basic Android stuff.
